LitePlacer is "The Low Cost Prototype Builderâ€™s Pick and Place Machine". It's an affordable, open source pick and place machine that you can buy right now in kit form from http://www.liteplacer.com/. The LitePlacer software is very good and is designed to work specifically with the machine. You can also run OpenPnP to control the LitePlacer. OpenPnP does offer some additional features and supports a rich variety of feeder types.

**To use OpenPnP with LitePlacer you have to physically swap the zmin and zmax limit switch wires on the included TinyG** and then you can use [[GcodeDriver]] to power the machine.

**Some of the TinyG settings also need to be modified.** See [TinyG Configuration Settings](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/TinyG-Configuation-Settings) for an initial set that is known to work with OpenPnP.
