# The following is a work in progress...

In order for OpenPnP to successfully place a part on a board, it needs to "know" where the part should be positioned on the board, and, just as importantly, it also needs to "know" where the board is positioned on the machine. That first bit of knowledge comes from the CAD database for the board. Because there is no universal standard for how that information is represented, OpenPnP provide importers for several popular CAD tools that translate the information from the tool to the proper format and conventions used by OpenPnP.

The figure below depicts a generalized board design of no particular shape one might create with a CAD tool:

Note that the board has a coordinate system denoted by arrows pointing in the positive X-axis (red) direction and in the positive Y-axis (cyan) direction. When viewed from the top side of the board, the positive Y-axis is 90 degrees counterclockwise from the positive X-axis. In addition, each placement also has a similar coordinate system in which the footprint pads are defined for the part. An important point is that both of these coordinate systems are defined in the CAD tool but there are some important considerations on how they should be defined in order to work successfully with OpenPnP:

* OpenPnP expects the origin of each placement coordinate system to be at the center of the smallest rectangle that encloses all of the footprint's pads. This is the point where OpenPnP will touch the part with the nozzle tip when picking the part.
* As mentioned above, OpenPnP needs to "know" where the board is positioned on the machine. This is accomplished by telling OpenPnP where the origin of the board's coordinate system is located and how it is oriented with respect to the machine. To that end, it is imperative when designing the board, to place its coordinate system such that it is easily identifiable when viewed through the top (down looking) camera. A common practice is to place the origin of the coordinate system at a corner of the board with its axes aligned with the edges of the board. However, in some cases that may not be possible, for example, a circular board has no corners or straight edges. In that case, some other visually identifiable feature such as the center of a particular placement, the center a particular pad in a row of pads, or even a special alignment mark could be used. Another consideration if the board has placements on both sides is that the coordinate system must be identifiable when viewed from either side. That is not a problem if using a corner of the board but if some other feature is being used, there must be an equivalent feature on the opposite side as well.
